# The Erdős–Straus conjecture: a serious attempt, and an honest map of the wall

*Working notes, 2026-08-16. Companion computations: `verify.py` (runs in ~2 s).*

**Conjecture (Erdős–Straus, 1948).** For every integer n ≥ 2 there are positive
integers x, y, z with

    4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z.

**Status (checked 2026-08-16):** open. It is problem
[#242 on erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/242) (page last edited
2026-05-07, listed *Open*). Despite the 2025–26 wave of AI-assisted resolutions
of Erdős problems (Tao's Jan-2026 milestone post; Quanta 2026-08-03), #242 has no
claimed solution, partial or complete. Known landscape (from the problem page and
literature; citations below partly from memory, flagged where so):

* Verified computationally for all n up to at least 10^17 (Salez 2014; a 2025
  verification [MiDu25] extends this — exact bound not retained).
* Mordell (1969): identities cover all n except n ≡ 1², 11², 13², 17², 19², 23²
  (mod 840). Terzi (1971) extended the modulus to 120120.
* Vaughan (1970): #exceptions below N is ≪ N·exp(−c(log N)^{2/3}).
* Elsholtz–Tao (2013): counting solutions for prime n; lower bounds on average.
* Bright–Loughran (2020): **no Brauer–Manin obstruction** — no known algebraic
  mechanism by which the conjecture could be false.
* Bloom–Elsholtz (2022), Thm 1: an equivalence recasting the conjecture as a
  two-case divisor condition (same shape as the criterion derived independently
  below).
* Schinzel: no polynomial identity can cover a residue class r (mod m) when r is
  a square mod m — so covering-congruence proofs provably cannot finish the job.

Everything below is derived and proved from scratch unless marked *(cited)*.
Section 7 states exactly what is new-ish here, what is folklore, and where the
attempt stops.

## 1. Reductions

**Lemma 1.1 (composite reduction).** If 4/a = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z then
4/(ab) = 1/(bx) + 1/(by) + 1/(bz). Hence it suffices to prove the conjecture
for n prime, plus n = 4 (4/4 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/4) covering powers of 2 via the
factor 4, and 4/2 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/2·(n=2 direct). So: **odd primes p only**. ∎

**Lemma 1.2 (easy classes).** The following exact identities hold (symbolically
verified in `verify.py (e)`):

* p ≡ 3 (mod 4), h = (p+1)/4:  4/p = 1/h + 1/(2hp) + 1/(2hp).
* p ≡ 2 (mod 3), k = (p+1)/3:  4/p = 1/p + 1/k + 1/(kp).
* p ≡ 5 (mod 8), g = (p+3)/8:  4/p = 1/(2g) + 1/(pg) + 1/(2pg).

Hence the conjecture is open only for **p ≡ 1 (mod 24)**. ∎

**Lemma 1.3 (at most two denominators divisible by p).** If p | x, y, z, write
x = px′ etc.; then 4 = 1/x′ + 1/y′ + 1/z′ ≤ 3, impossible. So in any solution p
divides exactly one or exactly two of x, y, z (it divides at least one since
4xyz = p(xy + yz + zx)). ∎

We call the two cases **Case A** (exactly one multiple of p) and **Case B**
(exactly two). *(In the literature these are the Type II / Type I solutions of
Aigner and Rosati — labels from memory, possibly swapped.)*

## 2. The two-term lemma

**Lemma 2.1.** Let a, b be coprime positive integers. Then a/b = 1/y + 1/z has a
solution in positive integers iff b² has a divisor d with d ≡ −b (mod a); the
solutions are exactly y = (b + d)/a, z = (b + b²/d)/a over such d.

*Proof.* (⇐) Given such d, set d′ = b²/d. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, d is invertible
mod a and d′ ≡ b²(−b)^{-1} ≡ −b (mod a), so both y and z are positive integers.
Then (d + b)(d′ + b) = dd′ + b(d + d′) + b² = b(d + d′ + 2b), so
1/y + 1/z = a(d + d′ + 2b)/((d+b)(d′+b)) = a/b.
(⇒) Given a solution, 1/y < a/b gives ay − b > 0; set d = ay − b, d″ = az − b.
From ayz = b(y + z): dd″ = a²yz − ab(y+z) + b² = b², so d | b² and
d ≡ −b (mod a). ∎

## 3. The complete criterion

**Theorem 3.1.** Let p be an odd prime. Then 4/p = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z is solvable
iff at least one of the following holds:

* **(B)** there is an integer q > 0 with q ≡ −p (mod 4) and a divisor d of x²,
  where x := (p + q)/4, such that q | d + x;
* **(A)** there is an integer m > 0 with m ≡ 3p (mod 4) and a divisor d of z₀²,
  where z₀ := (pm + 1)/4, such that m | d + z₀.

Explicitly, in case (B) the solution is
( x, p(x + d)/q, p(x + x²/d)/q ), and in case (A) it is
( (z₀ + d)/m, (z₀ + z₀²/d)/m, p z₀ ).

*Proof.* By Lemma 1.3 every solution is Case A or Case B.

Case B: solutions with y = py′, z = pz′, p ∤ x. Then
4/p − 1/x = (4x − p)/(px) = (1/p)(1/y′ + 1/z′), i.e. q/x = 1/y′ + 1/z′ with
q := 4x − p > 0 (positivity forced since the left side must be positive), and
q ≡ −p (mod 4). Also gcd(q, x) = gcd(p, x) = 1 (p | x would put p in all three
denominators, excluded by Lemma 1.3). Lemma 2.1 applied to q/x gives the stated
condition and formulas, both directions. Conversely any (q, d) as in (B) yields
a valid solution by direct substitution (checked symbolically; the computation
is Lemma 2.1's). Note x ranges over all integers > p/4 as q ranges as stated.

Case A: solutions with z = pz₀, p ∤ xy. From 4xyz₀ = xy + pz₀(x + y):
xy(4z₀ − 1) = pz₀(x + y), and p ∤ xy forces p | 4z₀ − 1; write 4z₀ − 1 = pm.
Then m/z₀ = (x + y)/(xy) = 1/x + 1/y, gcd(m, z₀) = gcd(m, (pm+1)/4) = 1 since
4z₀ ≡ 1 (mod m). Lemma 2.1 gives the condition; m ≡ 3p (mod 4) is exactly
integrality of z₀ = (pm+1)/4. Both directions as before. ∎

*(This matches the shape of Bloom–Elsholtz 2022, Thm 1 — cited; derived
independently here.)*

**Empirics** (`verify.py (a)–(b)`): for every prime 3 ≤ p < 10⁵ a Case-B witness
exists with q ≤ 63; every reconstructed solution verified exactly. Worst case:
p = 87481 needs q = 63. The stubborn p = 1201 from the play session: witness
q = 23, d = 108, x = 306, giving 4/1201 = 1/306 + 1/21618 + 1/61251.

## 4. Identity families and what they cover

Fix q and d and *force* d | x² by congruences: let R₀(d) := ∏_{r^e ∥ d} r^⌈e/2⌉
(the minimal R with R | x ⇒ d | x²; note R₀ | d and d ≤ R₀²). A **guaranteed
family** is (q, d, R) with R₀(d) | R; it covers the arithmetic progression

    { p : 4 | p + q,  x ≡ 0 (mod R),  x ≡ −d (mod q) },   x = (p+q)/4,

a single class mod M = 4·lcm(R, q) when consistent. Every prime in it is
solvable by Theorem 3.1(B). Case-A families (m, d, R) are defined mirror-wise.
Two more shapes close the classical zoo:

* **F1 (two-parameter):** p = 4guv − u − v ⇒
  4/p = 1/(guv) + 1/(pgu) + 1/(pgv) (exact identity, `verify.py (e)`).
  For fixed (u, v) it covers the class p ≡ −(u+v) (mod 4uv), g free.
* **L (linear-q, d = 1):** q = (x+1)/j linear in x: jp = (4j−1)x − 1 covers
  exactly p ≡ −4 (mod 4j − 1), j free. (j = 1 is the mod-3 identity; j = 2
  covers p ≡ 3 (mod 7); j = 3 covers p ≡ 7 (mod 11), …)

Worked examples derived by hand and verified: (q=7, d=2): covers
p ≡ 41 (mod 56), e.g. 4/97 = 1/26 + 1/388 + 1/5044. (q=15, d=8, R=4): covers
p ≡ 193 (mod 240), e.g. 4/193 = 1/52 + 1/772 + 1/5018. (q=7, d=5, R=5): covers
p ≡ 113 (mod 140), e.g. 4/673 = 1/170 + 1/16825 + 1/572050.

**Empirics** (`verify.py (d)`): a finite system (constant families with q < 60,
d ≤ 100; L with j ≤ 50; F1 with u ≤ v ≤ 20) covers 9588 of the 9591 primes
below 10⁵ — misses only 61681, 67369, 87481, all in the six hard classes mod
840, and each of those still has a (non-forced) witness. This is the "identities
nibble forever but cannot finish" phenomenon, which the next section makes into
a theorem.

## 5. The obstruction: a self-contained mini-Schinzel theorem

**Theorem 5.1.** No guaranteed family (Case A or B, any padding R) covers even a
single prime p ≡ 1 (mod N), for any N divisible by the family's modulus M.

*Proof.* Let the family be (q, d, R), M = 4·lcm(R, q), and suppose some prime
p ≡ 1 (mod N), M | N, lies in the family's class c (mod M). Then c ≡ 1 (mod M).
Since the (q,d,R)-class is contained in the (q,d,R₀)-class and the moduli divide
each other, we may assume R = R₀(d), so **R | d and d ≤ R²**.

From c ≡ 1 (mod M):
- mod 4R: R | x gives 4R | 4x, so p ≡ 4x − q ≡ −q, hence q ≡ −1 (mod 4R);
  in particular q ≥ 4R − 1.
- mod q: x ≡ −d gives p ≡ −4d, hence q | 4d + 1; write t = (4d+1)/q ≥ 1.

Then t ≤ (4R² + 1)/(4R − 1) = R + (R+1)/(4R−1) < R + 1, so **t ≤ R**.
But mod 4R: since R | d, 4d ≡ 0 (mod 4R), so qt = 4d + 1 ≡ 1, and q ≡ −1 gives
t ≡ −1 (mod 4R), so **t ≥ 4R − 1 > R**. Contradiction. The Case-A computation
is verbatim with m in place of q. ∎

**Lemma 5.2 (other shapes).** F1 with parameters (u,v) covers no p ≡ 1
(mod 4uv): that would need 4uv | u + v + 1, but 0 < u + v + 1 ≤ 2uv + 1 < 4uv.
L with parameter j covers no p ≡ 1 (mod 4j−1): that would need (4j−1) | 5,
impossible as 5's divisors are 1, 5 ≢ 3 (mod 4). ∎

**Corollary 5.3.** Let S be any finite collection of families of the above
shapes and N the lcm of 4 and all their moduli. By Dirichlet there are
infinitely many primes p ≡ 1 (mod N), and by 5.1–5.2 *none* of them is covered
by any member of S. Hence no finite congruence-identity system of these shapes
can prove the conjecture. ∎

*(Schinzel's theorem — cited, not reproved here — extends this to arbitrary
polynomial identities 4/(mt + r) with r a square mod m. Theorem 5.1 is the
special case actually needed to explain the failure of every covering system in
the literature, and its proof above is elementary and self-contained.)*

## 6. Why the six classes resist: the parity mechanism

**Lemma 6.1 (Jacobi obstruction).** Let q ≡ 3 (mod 4), gcd(q, x) = 1,
x = (p+q)/4. If every prime factor r of x has Jacobi symbol (r|q) = +1, then no
divisor d of x² satisfies d ≡ −x (mod q) — the witness condition for this q
fails unconditionally.

*Proof.* All divisors d of x² then satisfy (d|q) = +1 and (x|q) = +1. But
d ≡ −x (mod q) forces (d|q) = (−1|q)(x|q) = −1, since (−1|q) = −1 for
q ≡ 3 (mod 4). ∎

**Empirics** (`verify.py (c)`): among hard-class primes p < 10⁵, of all 453
pairs (p, q) with q below the minimal witness, 92.9% are explained by Lemma 6.1
(the rest have a QNR factor but miss the exact coset).

**The q = 3 case is exactly solvable and reveals the mechanism.** For
p ≡ 2 (mod 3): x ≡ 2 (mod 3) and d = 1 works — witness *forced by congruence
alone* (this IS the classical mod-3 identity). For p ≡ 1 (mod 3): x ≡ 1 (mod 3),
the witness needs d ≡ 2 (mod 3), and such a divisor of x² exists **iff x has a
prime factor ≡ 2 (mod 3)**. But x ≡ 1 (mod 3) means the number of prime factors
of x that are ≡ 2 (mod 3) (with multiplicity) is *even* — so the generic
"exactly one" case is excluded, and the failure event "zero such factors" has
enhanced probability. Verified: for all 273 hard-class primes p < 10⁵, q = 3
has a witness iff (p+3)/4 has a prime factor ≡ 2 (mod 3) — 0 mismatches; only
32% succeed, versus the ≥ 80% naive density prediction for unconditioned
integers of that size.

**This is the conceptual unification.** A residue class of p is "easy" exactly
when the induced congruence on x forces odd QNR-multiplicity (hence a usable
divisor exists *by congruence*, giving an identity); it is "hard" exactly when p
≡ square forces even multiplicity, so witness existence degenerates from a
congruence consequence into a **factorization event** with no congruence
handle — which is Schinzel's obstruction seen mechanically. For q > 3 the
character argument only narrows d to a coset-half; hitting the exact coset needs
either forced small divisors (the identity zoo of §4) or luck (the 92.9%/7.1%
split above).

## 7. Where exactly this attempt stops

What the sections above amount to:

* **Proved from scratch:** Lemmas 1.1–1.3, 2.1, Theorem 3.1 (the complete
  solvability criterion, both directions), the identity families of §4 with
  exact symbolic verification, Theorem 5.1 + Corollary 5.3 (elementary
  obstruction theorem: no finite system of divisor-forced congruence families
  proves ES), Lemma 6.1, and the q=3 parity characterization of §6. All of this
  is essentially known to experts (Rosati, Aigner, Mordell, Schinzel,
  Bloom–Elsholtz), but the derivations here are independent and self-contained;
  I make no novelty claim beyond, possibly, the packaging of §5–§6.
* **The missing lemma** — all that separates this from a proof:

  > For every prime p ≡ 1 (mod 24) there exists q ≡ 3 (mod 4) such that the
  > divisors of x², x = (p+q)/4, meet the residue class −x (mod q)
  > (or the Case-A mirror with z₀ = (pm+1)/4 mod m).

  Empirically q ≤ 63 suffices below 10⁵ and the minimal q grows extremely
  slowly, if at all.
* **Why the missing lemma is hard, precisely:**
  1. For any *single* q (or finite set of q), Lemma 6.1 shows failure occurs on
     a set of p of positive density — the factorization of (p+q)/4 can be
     all-QR mod q. So one must play infinitely many q against each other.
  2. The failure events across q are correlated only through the factorizations
     of the numbers (p+q)/4, q = 3, 7, 11, … — an additive shift family. Proving
     that *some* member of an additive family has a prescribed multiplicative
     property, **uniformly for every p**, is exactly the type of statement
     (cf. least-nonresidue problems, smooth numbers in short APs) that current
     analytic number theory delivers only "for almost all" or "for large enough
     ... under GRH"-style. Vaughan's bound (exceptions ≪ N exp(−c(log N)^{2/3}))
     is precisely the almost-all shadow of this heuristic; it has not been
     improved to "all" in 55 years.
  3. There is no structural escape hatch to hope for on the negative side
     either: Bright–Loughran (2020) show no Brauer–Manin obstruction, and the
     heuristic solution count (Elsholtz–Tao) grows like a power of log p — the
     conjecture is "true with lots of room", which is exactly why a
     counterexample search is hopeless and why the difficulty is purely one of
     uniformity, not of truth.
* **What would constitute genuine progress** (attempted, not achieved here):
  (i) an unconditional proof that q ≤ (log p)^{O(1)} suffices — this would need
  character-sum estimates on divisor-coset hitting beyond Burgess-type
  uniformity; (ii) exploiting *joint* structure across q (the numbers (p+q)/4
  for varying q share no useful algebraic relation I could find — their pairwise
  gcds are bounded); (iii) an algebraic identity outside the divisor-forced
  shapes — ruled out for all shapes formalized here by Theorem 5.1, and for all
  polynomial shapes by Schinzel.

**Honest bottom line.** The conjecture remains open here. The concrete outputs
are: a complete, self-contained criterion (Thm 3.1); an elementary and, in this
packaging, possibly novel proof that no finite divisor-forced congruence system
can settle it (Thm 5.1/Cor 5.3); the parity-mechanism explanation of *why* the
six quadratic-residue classes mod 840 are the hard ones (§6, verified with zero
mismatches on all hard-class primes < 10⁵); and a precise, minimal statement of
the missing lemma together with the reason it sits beyond current uniformity
technology.
