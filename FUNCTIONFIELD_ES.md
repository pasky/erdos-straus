# FUNCTIONFIELD_ES — Erdős–Straus over F_q[T]: the landscape at fixed q, deg P → ∞ (O161)

Status: in progress (O161). Scripts `scripts/ffl_*`. Background: `BRAINSTORM/ff_erdos_straus.md` (O140; Lemma 1.1,
Prop 1.2, Lemma 1.3, Thm 2.1), `BRAINSTORM/padic_functionfield_igusa.md` (+ errata), triage A/B. ES is not solved
anywhere; nothing here bears on ES over Z except as a model ("toy universe").

Literature (one web search, 2026-10-12): no treatment of a 3-term Erdős–Straus analogue over F_q[T] found
(hits: other Erdős conjectures over F_q[x] — arXiv:2407.15146, Xie arXiv:2510.17612; Guerrieri, "From ancient
Egyptian fractions to modern algebra", is about representability by Egyptian fractions in domains, not 3 terms).
Novelty therefore unverified but plausible.

## 1. The analogue, fixed precisely

Notation: q = p^r, R = F_q[T], P monic irreducible of degree n, A monic of degree k ≥ 1 with P ∤ A.
For a polynomial F write |F| = q^{deg F} (the place ∞).

**Definition 1.1 (ES_q(A, P), the faithful form).** There are monic X, Y, Z ∈ R with
`A/P = 1/X + 1/Y + 1/Z` and `|1/X|, |1/Y|, |1/Z| ≤ |A/P|` (i.e. every denominator has degree ≥ n − k).

The degree condition ("no cancellation at ∞", NC) is the ultrametric image of the archimedean fact that over Z,
`4/n = 1/x+1/y+1/z` with x, y, z > 0 forces every 1/x_i < 4/n. "Monic" is Hayes' sign normalisation of
positivity. Without any sign condition the problem degenerates (§1.4).

**Lemma 1.2 (NC is automatic in char ≥ 3; PROVED).** Let X, Y, Z be monic with A/P = 1/X + 1/Y + 1/Z, and let
m be the number of denominators of minimal degree d₁. The coefficient of T^{−d₁} in the expansion at ∞ is m·1.
(i) If m ≢ 0 (mod p) then d₁ = n − k and m ≡ 1 (mod p). Then NC holds.
(ii) char ≥ 5: m ∈ {1,2,3} is never 0 mod p, so every monic solution satisfies NC, with m = 1 (O140 Lemma 1.1).
(iii) char 3: m = 3 (cancellation, d₁ < n − k) is possible for monic solutions. But a monic solution with
some denominator of degree n − k satisfies NC: if deg Y < n − k, the minimal degree is attained by Y alone or by
Y, Z (m ∈ {1,2}, nonzero), giving degree −deg Y ≠ k − n for the sum.
(iv) char 2: m = 2 (cancellation) is possible; m ∈ {1,3} under NC.
*Proof.* Leading-term bookkeeping, as in O140 Lemma 1.1. ∎

So "monic" alone already gives the faithful analogue in char ≥ 5 (O149's worry that monic allows cancellation is
only realised in char 2 and 3, as triage B observed). In char 2 and 3 we take NC as part of the definition, and
study the monic-only variant M separately (§6).

**Lemma 1.3 (e-slice criterion, all characteristics; PROVED).** ES_q(A, P) holds iff there exist a monic X of
degree n − k and monic a, b | PX with E := AX − P dividing a + b ≠ 0 and lc(a + b) = lc(E).
*Proof.* O140 Lemma 1.3 verbatim; the char ≥ 5 restriction there was used only to locate X. Under NC some
denominator has degree n − k; call it X. Then E ≠ 0 (else A/P = 1/X, impossible by degrees) and deg E < n (AX
and P are monic of degree n). (⇐) gives Y = κPX/a, Z = κPX/b with κ = (a+b)/E monic. NC for Y: if P ∤ a then
deg a ≤ n − k and deg Y ≥ n. If P | a, P ∤ b then deg(a+b) = deg a and deg κ ≥ deg a − (n−1), so
deg Y ≥ n − k + 1. If P | a, b then E | (a+b)/P (gcd(E,P) = 1), deg κ ≥ n, deg Y ≥ n. Same for Z. (⇒) y + z ≠ 0 because y = z = 1 would give 2/g = E/N, and in char 2 this means
E = 0. ∎
