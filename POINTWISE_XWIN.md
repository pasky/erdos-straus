### 1.1 The half-set lemma

Let `a≡3 (4)`, `a≥3`, `G=(Z/a)^×`. The Klein group `V={id, g↦g^{-1},
g↦−g, g↦−g^{-1}}` acts on G. Since `a≡3 (4)`, −1 is not a square mod a
(some prime factor of a is ≡3 (4)), so `g≠−g^{-1}`; and `g≠−g` as a is odd.
Hence every V-orbit is either
* a *4-orbit* `{g,g^{-1},−g,−g^{-1}}` (when `g²≠1`), or
* a *2-orbit* `{g,−g}` (when `g²=1`); one of them is `{1,−1}`.

Split every 4-orbit as `{g,g^{-1}} ⊔ {−g,−g^{-1}}` and every 2-orbit as
`{g} ⊔ {−g}`. A *selection* σ picks one half of every orbit, with the
constraint that it picks `{1}` from `{1,−1}`. Put `S_σ`= union of the
picked halves. Then `|S_σ|=φ(a)/2` exactly, and the number of selections is
`2^{β(a)}`, `β(a)=(φ(a)−2^{ω(a)})/4+2^{ω(a)−1}−1 ≤ φ(a)/4+2^{ω(a)-2}`.
(The elements with `g²=1` number `2^{ω(a)}` because a is odd.)

For an integer x prime to a let `C(x)⊆G` be the set of classes of the
prime factors of x.

**Lemma 1.1 (half-set lemma; PROVED).** If `−1∉Rat_a(x)`, then
`C(x)⊆S_σ` for some selection σ. In particular this holds whenever window
a fails.

*Proof.* `Rat_a(x)` contains `r` (u=r, v=1), `rs` (u=rs, v=1) and `r/s`
(u=r, v=s) for all distinct primes `r,s|x`. So `−1∉Rat_a(x)` gives:
`−1∉C(x)`; and no `g,h∈C(x)` (distinct classes; for equal classes
`g·g=g²≠−1`, `g/g=1≠−1`) satisfy `gh=−1` or `g/h=−1`, i.e.
`C(x)∩(−C(x))=∅` and `C(x)∩(−C(x)^{-1})=∅`.
Inside a 4-orbit, `g` excludes `−g` and `−g^{-1}`, and `g^{-1}` excludes
the same two elements; so `C(x)` meets the orbit inside one half. Inside a
2-orbit `{g,−g}` the two elements exclude each other, and `−1` is
excluded outright. Choose σ accordingly (arbitrarily on orbits that
`C(x)` misses). ∎

*Remarks.* (i) For prime a this contains notes Cor 70.2 (σ with
`S_σ=Q`, the squares) and the F3 case: F3 failures are confined to a
non-subgroup half-set, e.g. `a=7`, `x=17`: `C={3}⊆{1,3,5}`.
(ii) Unlike notes (71.4), the majorant has **no budget exception**: every
failure, F1 or F3 or the composite-modulus subgroup misses of notes
Thm 70.10, is a pure confinement event of density exactly 1/2. This is
what removes the obstacle that limited notes Cor 71.4 to the exponent
`δ_J=Σ1/(a−1)`.
(iii) Only the target −1 and products of at most two primes are used, so
everything below bounds the larger event "Type II fails at all windows of
A", a fortiori the window failure.
